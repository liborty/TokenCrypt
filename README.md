# TokenCrypt

**A simple utility to encrypt and decrypt directories of security tokens and any other files.
High security without onerous complications.**

## Version 1.1.2  [![Actions Status](https://github.com/liborty/TokenCrypt/workflows/compilation/badge.svg)](https://github.com/liborty/TokenCrypt/actions) [![Actions Status](https://github.com/liborty/TokenCrypt/workflows/test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/liborty/TokenCrypt/actions)

## Outline

Internet security tokens are usually 32,64 or more hexadecimal characters. 
They are increasingly used to facilitate secure access to various 
Applications Programming Interfaces (APIs). Being plain text,
they are easily transmitted over the internet but they need to be stored securely,
that means encrypted. 

TokenCrypt takes whole directories of tokens
and/or any other files, recognises hexadecimal data, applies the best compression 
process individually to each file and then encrypts them all with extremely high security.

There may be files and directories, perhaps even whole databases of security tokens,
all mixed up with other types of files. This is perhaps not the best practice but 
it may well arise and could involve much work to separate them. TokenCrypt copes with it
automagically: `hexcheck.c` detects entirely hexadecimal files.

The main workhorse of TokenCrypt is `symcrypt.c` which does fast symmetric
encryption or decryption of any type of file of any length. It uses practically no memory.

Then there are two bash scripts to automate the encryption and decryption,
subsuming compression and keys generation. Plus an automated overall testing script.

The hexadecimal (token) files are automatically recognised and converted to binary, 
which halves them in length.

Then modern zstd compression is applied but only if it results in a smaller file.
(This will not generally be true for small and/or binary files).

Finally, the binary encryptor `symcrypt.c` is applied.

Decryption is the inverse of this process. See the scripts `ncrpt` and `dcrpt` for details.
However, the knowledge of the algorithm is not necessary for effective TokenCrypt use.

The entire process of encryption and decryption can be automatically
tested using the script `crptest`.

## Installation

This software was tested under Linux. Installation from source needs just a C compiler,
either clang or gcc. Download or clone this directory, cd into it and then:  

**`make CC=clang`**

or using a default compiler, usually gcc, just say: **`make`**

When you are using a typical Linux, you can skip the compilation step. 
Then the pre-compiled binaries `symcrypt` and `hexcheck` included in this repository
will be installed by default.

**`sudo ./install`**
 
Copies all the executables for system-wide use into /usr/local/bin.  
To remove them again, use: **`sudo ./uninstall`**

Alternatively, you can, of course, copy them manually to any of your own `bin` 
directories in your path and this does not require `sudo` privileges, e.g.:

`cp symcrypt hexcheck ncrpt dcrpt crptest ~/bin`

### Dependencies

Standard utility **`xxd`** which is normally pre-installed.
  
**`zstd`** compression needs installing. If you prefer `lzma` as in some of
the earlier versions, you can change it back in `ncrpt` and `dcrpt`, not forgetting
the extension names.

## Usage

**`ncrpt`** path/dirname

Fresh individual keys are generated for all the files in `path/dirname` and
written to the directory `./dirname_key` that mirrors the encrypted files
which go into `./dirname_crp` (in the current directory).
Overall input and output sizes and the number of files processed are reported.

**`dcrpt`** path/dirname_key path/dirname_crp

is the inverse of `ncrpt`. It uses the keys in  `path/dirname_key` to decrypt 
their name corresponding files in `path/dirname_crp`.
All the decrypted results are written into `./dirname_org` (in the current directory).

## Testing

**`crptest`** path/dirname 

Automatically tests `ncrpt` and `dcrpt`. It first encrypts and then decrypts back again
all the files in the given input directory and compares the results against the original files.
It cleans up after itself except for the keys directory `./dirname_key`,
which is left for reassurance and for information about how was each test file compressed. 
There should be only a blank produced after "crptest found these differences:"

Automated 'github action' runs `crptest` over `testing` directory that is
included in the repository.
It tests all the main types of files: hexadecimal, text and binary. 
The 'test' badge at the top of this document lights up green as 'passing'
when the test was successful. Note that only the terminal output `test.log`
is saved in the repository from this automatic test.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**What if `crptest` reports missing NL and/or spaces in hex files?**

It may report some missing spaces and newlines in reconstructed hexadecimal files.
This is because `hexcheck` tolerates them but deletes them silently, as they are
not hexadecimal characters ( `xxd` does the same ). 
However, note that, unlike `xxd`, `hexcheck` rejects any other white noise or non printable
characters and therefore such files are not treated as hexadecimal.
See the next question below.

The problem is that a binary file could consist entirely of non-printable
characters. Deleting them all and declaring such (empty) file to be hexadecimal would
be a silly bug. Even when mixed half and half, at what point could we say that it is
now a hexadecimal file? That is why the hexadecimal check has to be quite strict.

When this report happens, it is a useful reminder to remove the white noise 
from your original hex files. The spaces and newlines can be removed simply
by running `ncrpt` and `dcrpt` and then substituting the original hexadecimal files with their
reconstructed cleaned-up equivalents in `./dirname_org`.

**Why are my hex files getting less than 50% compressed?**

They should normally get at least 50% compressed. If you have a whole directory
full of genuine hexadecimal files, the overall compression will be quite dramatic.

Any spurious white noise or other non-hexadecimal characters, even just one of them,
will make `hexcheck` report the file as non-hexadecimal and its compression will
be limited. It may be worth checking that what you thought were hexadecimal files
were actually accepted as such. This will be indicated by their keys in `./dirname_key`
having a `.hex` extension in their names. If the original file already had a .hex extension,
it should now have two.

**Why does `crptest` report differences between some upper and lower case letters?**
 
This is the normal behaviour. A-F letters in hex files are intentionally changed
by `hexcheck` into their
lower case equivalents a-f (standard hexadecimal form). Again, you can replace the
original file with its reconstructed version to prevent the repetition of these reports.

**How to get more hexadecimal files accepted?**

When a token consist of several parts, perhaps separated by a dash or some
other intervening non-hexadecimal characters, it is best to split it manually into individual
files, each containing only pure hexadecimal. Any remaining spaces and newlines 
will be accepted but note that they will be deleted in the process.

**What happens to impure hexadecimal files?**

Impure 'hexadecimal' files/tokens still containing any non-hex characters
will be naively compressed and encrypted as they are, just 
like any other files. However, this is sub-optimal, as they can end up twice as
long as they needed to be. It may be a pessimisation of security as well.

**What if `crptest` reports other differences?**

Should it list any other differences, then something has gone wrong. It will most
likely be some problem with the directories structure or accessability.
The original files in `path/dirname` will be untouched.

**When can I start deleting my original files?**

These are left untouched in their original `path/dirname` and it is up to you
not to lose them. Do not start deleting any of the originals until you 
are satisfied that the testing was successful, you have invoked `ncrpt path/dirname` 
to encrypt for real, and double-checked manually that the encrypted files and keys exist
and are of a reasonable non-zero size. The output of ncrpt reports the overall size.

**How does `dcrpt` know the actual methods of compression that were used?**

Good question! As we have seen, hex compression and/or zstd compression may or may not
be applied to any given file, depending on what is the best for it.
This information is recorded in the extension appended to the filename
of its key in `./dirname_key`. (While the filenames of the encrypted files are left 
exactly the same as those of the original files).

Be careful not to interfere with the keys' extensions, as this would prevent
successful decryption. As would changing any of the keys' filenames in general.

**What is the biggest hazard in using TokenCrypt?**

Misplacing, corrupting, failing to update the backup of, or accidentally
overwriting the keys in the generated `./dirname_key` directory.
In two short words: losing them. 

The keys directory should be kept somewhere separate from 
`./dirname_crp` for security reasons but the rub is that this makes it easier to lose.
You need to be well organised with your file backups (in two different places)
and the directories correspondences across them.
