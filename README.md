## Security Advice

The encryption keys (keydir) and the encrypted files (outdir) are written into two separate directories with user specified names. Should the association between them be lost or forgotten or the keydir be lost entirely, then it will be impossible to reconstruct the original data! Therefore, it is recommended to record the chosen directories names and to store them in a safe place, before ever deleting the original data. When using TokenCrypt as a back up and archiving tool, then the original data will normally be kept in place.

The encrypted files (written to outdir) are just meaningless random data and thus can be stored anywhere, even 'on the cloud'. The same applies to their keys (in keydir), although these reveal the type of compression that was used. The critical part is to prevent a potential eavesdropper from matching up those two directories, as that is the only way to decrypt them. That is why they are not given related names automatically. Normally, the user should choose unrelated names for them and keep them in separate places. 

Before uploading anything to the internet, read the section below entitled More Secure Alternative.

## Introduction

It is not an objective of TokenCrypt to replace `git` and to keep the complete histories of everything, as that carries significant costs in complexity and storage. The quest for being totally foolproof is subject to the law of diminishing returns, as foolishness knows no bounds. TokenCrypt is more akin to `borg`; an efficient archiver and backing up tool. The key difference, if excuse the pun, lies in TokenCrypt deploying far more secure encryption and sometimes better compression as well. On the other hand, in its update mode, it only maintains the current version of the archive. Historical checkpoints are up to the user to create and keep, as and when wanted.

`ncrpt` reads given input directory (tree) containing API tokens, base64 files and
any other types of files. Subdirectories are processed recursively with -r option.
This script recognises hexadecimal files and base64 files and converts them to compact binary data.
It then selects the best compression method individually for each file and finally encrypts them all with total security.

Some well known compressed formats afford only minor further compression, if any.
To save time, they are recognised here simply by their well known extensions:
`jpg,jpeg,mp4,zip,7z,lz,zst,gz,bz2` and their upper case versions.
All attempts at compressing these particular files are avoided.

Internet security tokens usually consist of 32, 64 or more hexadecimal characters. They are increasingly used to facilitate secure access over the internet protocols to various Applications Programming Interfaces (APIs). Being plain text, they are easily transmitted but they need to be stored securely, that means strongly encrypted.

Base64 encoding into printable characters is also used to encode binary data, for similar reasons.

Hexadecimal security tokens, base64 files and other types of files may sometimes be all mixed up in one common directory. This is not the best practice but it can arise. It could involve much work trying to separate them all.

`ncrpt -b -x` copes with such mixed directories contents by
applying these two data type recognition tests to each file individually. In this case it does not rely on extension names, as that could lead to errors.

## Installation

This software was developed and tested under Linux. Installation from source needs `make` utility and a `C` compiler, e.g. `clang` or `gcc`. Download or clone this repository and cd into it. Then, for complete fresh installation:  
### `./crptest testing`  
This will compile all three `C` programs and, after asking for su priviledges, install them and the bash scripts in `/usr/local/bin`. As an added benefit, it will also run locally the same test as is done on github.

### Manual alternatives:

#### `sudo ./uninstall`  
will delete previously installed programs and scripts. Use to force a completely fresh start. To be followed by:

#### `./install`  
This installs everything without the local compilation. Thus the ready made executables `symcrypt`, `hexcheck` and `hexify`, pulled from the repository, can be installed on `x86_64` architecture. They are compiled from `C` sources and tested automatically at github.com (see the green badge at the top of this document).

Whether the executables were created by local compilation or just pulled from the repository, this script copies them all into `/usr/local/bin` for system-wide use.  Alternatively, they can be copied manually to any other `bin` directories and included in the search path. This does not require `sudo` privileges, e.g.:  
`cp symcrypt hexcheck hexify ncrpt dcrpt keygen crptest ~/bin`

#### `make install`  
Will compile and install everything into `/usr/local/bin`. It may ask for su priviledges for the integrated installation step. Appending `CC=clang` will deploy the clang compiler (if installed).

A good reason to perform local compilation is if you suspect that the github binaries may have been compromised or you have a different machine architecture from `x86_64`. This step should be repeated whenever some programs and scripts have changed, such as after a fresh `git pull`. It will only recompile the C programs that have actually changed.

#### `make`
This will only compile and install those C programs that have changed but  none of the Bash scripts.

## Dependencies

Standard `du` (disk usage) tool which is normally part of Linux.

Standard  `base64` tool which is normally pre-installed on Linux.

`lzma` is the default compression. It is normally pre-installed. If not, install it with:  
`sudo apt-get install lzma`
  
`zstd` an alternative compression, selectable with `-z` option to `ncrpt`. It needs to be installed with:  
`sudo apt-get install zstd`

`tar` is used by `expcrypt` and `impcrypt` to pack the encrypted directory into a single archive file for more convenient and secure export/import.

`dcrpt` issues a warning if any of the compression utilities are not installed. It is probably best to install them all.
There is not much difference between lzma and zstd but they both have their fans. `lzma`
appears to have slightly better compression rate and `zstd` is slightly faster and more controllable. Of course, to unpack/decrypt archives on a new machine, it must have the same compression/decompression utility installed, too.

## Usage

There are two command line interface (CLI) bash scripts that do most of the work and automate the whole process:

### `ncrpt [options] indir keydir outdir`

The long options introduced by `--` are also recognised.  
The options explained:

    -b --b64 test for base64 files, 
    -c --clean up the archive and the keys,
    -h --help,   
    -q --quiet, suppress the final report,
    -r --recurse, descend into subdirectories,
    -u --update an existing archive and keys,
    -v --verbose information on compressing each file
    -x --hex test for hexadecimal files, 
    -z --zstd compression to be used instead of lzma.     

When `-u` option is not given, then by default a new archive is created.  
Option `-c` only makes sense in combination with `-u`. It can do nothing for a brand new archive.

The tests for hexadecimal `-x` and base64 `-b` files should only be specified when the input directory likely contains such files. Even though these tests are relatively fast, as they usually fail after reading only a few bytes (of the wrong type of file). When omitted by mistake, then everything will still work, only the default compression of these types of files will take up more space than was strictly necessary.

The last three arguments are mandatory: the input directory, the keys directory and the encrypted directory. Both output directories (`keydir` and `outdir`) will mirror `indir` in their structure and file names; `keydir` will hold the keys and `outdir` will hold the encrypted files.

The summary at the end, such as the one shown in `test.log`, reports the sizes (in bytes) of input and output directories and the total compressed size as a percentage of the original size. The compression to 50% will  compensate for the creation  of the encryption keys. Sometimes even better compression may be achieved.

Option `-q` (`--quiet`) cancels the final report.
Option `-v` (`--verbose`) adds details of compressing each file. Selecting  both options, contradictory as it may seem, turns on the individual files reports and turns off the final summary. The encryption itself is so unproblematic that it does not require any reports.

Once a directory has been compressed and encrypted, it is on subsequent occasions possible to update the keys and outdir directories (the archive) with option -u. This will add or recode just the new and updated files. New files are added (marked with a:) and more recent existing files are updated (marked with u:). When the recursive option -r is in use, the same will be applied to subdirectories. Capital letters A,U denote these two operations when applied to whole directories.

In order for the state of the new indir and its archive to match again exactly one-to-one, an archive can be also cleaned up with option -c. Files no longer existing in indir will then be deleted (marked with d:) from the archive. With `-r -c` options, possibly whole directories can be deleted and marked with D:.

Caution should be exercised when using the -c option, as any files that had been inadvertently deleted from indir will then be removed from the archive as well. For added safety, option `-c` is deliberately made explicit and separate from `-u`. Thus using `-u` alone is the *cautious updating mode*, which never deletes anything from the archive. However, it will still overwrite existing files with their new, possibly erroneus, versions. Beware that this can cause loss of previously useful content. Of course, this is true in general, whenever changing any files by any means, anywhere.

The most powerful mode of operation on a previously created archive (keydir outdir) is 'recurse-update-clean'.
Options can be run together:

```bash
ncrpt -ruc indir keydir outdir
```

This will recursively update and clean the archive so that it is as if freshly created from the current state of indir. This is convenient for backing up purposes.

Summary: `ncrpt` (encrypt with vowels left out) executes the tasks of data type analysis, optimal compression selection, compression, key generation, key saving and encryption. Also recursive archiving and subsequent archive maintenance.

### `dcrpt -[h][q][r][v] indir keydir outdir`

is the conceptual inverse of `ncrpt`, although it is simpler. Its operations are carried out in exactly the reverse order.  It reads from indir the encrypted files previously created by `ncrpt` and it also reads their associated keys from `keydir`. They are paired up by their filenames. So, never rename an encrypted file, unless you rename its corresponding key file as well! The two directories must always match.

Following decryption, the relevant decompression method(s) are applied to each file, so that the original files are exactly reconstructed in `outdir`. The compression method(s) were recorded for each file in the names of the extension(s) of its keyfile.

Summary: `dcrpt` (decrypt with vowels left out) matches the keys, decrypts the binary indir files with them, selects the right decompression methods and  decompresses, thus reconstructing the exact contents of the original directory.

### `crptest testdir`

optionally performs an automated overall test, checking that not a single byte was corrupted anywhere while encrypting and decrypting back the contents of (any) `testdir`.

## More Secure Alternative

There is a vulnerability, inherent in `ncrpt` and `dcrpt` design, to specialist search engines sifting through the whole internet, possibly matching up pairs of (keydir outdir) directories by their same structures, file names and sizes. Thus, in theory, such engines could pair them up, even if they were uploaded to two unrelated places.

Two alternative scripts, `expcrypt` and `impcrypt`, address this vulnarability. It is recommended that `expcrypt` be used prior to exporting snapshots of the local indir to any unsecure locations, such as the internet; `impcrypt` is for importing them back (for recovery purposes). It unpacks, decrypts and decompresses.

The following can now be done:

* `expcrypt -r indir keyfile outfile`
* upload keyfile and outfile to two different places on the internet 
* delete everything locally, intentionally or by accident:  
`rm -rf indir keydir outdir`
* at any time and place later, download keyfile and outfile, then
* `impcrypt -r outfile keyfile indir`

This should result in recovered original state of indir. More securely saved in between.

### `expcrypt [options] indir keyfile outfile`

acts like `ncrpt` in the 'create new archive' mode. Therefore,  the updating options -u and -c no longer apply and have been removed from `expcrypt`. The most important difference is that instead of creating two matchable output directories, `expcrypt` creates two output files that betray no similarities. They even differ in size.

All the keys for the whole archive are now packed into one sequential `keyfile`, which replaces previous keydir. No filenames are any longer being duplicated or extra file extensions appended, which is a cleaner solution.

The total of nine different combinations of compressions can be used, as before, depending on the input file nd its compressibility properties.

The compressed and encrypted files that used to go to outdir are now for convenience tarred together, also into a single file. If the individual filenames are confidential too, then this file should be encrypted again.

There is a price to be paid in terms of the execution time. The entire indir tree structure now has to be traversed sequentially, thus reducing the opportunities for parallel execution (those are fully exploited by `ncrpt` and `dcrpt`).

### `impcrypt [options] infile keyfile outdir`

acts like `dcrpt`, except it interprets correctly the export files, here named infile,keyfile, created by `expcrypt`.

## Background Scripts and Programs (not needed by the user)

`hexcheck` (C executable) is invoked by `ncrpt -x`. It recognises hexadecimal (token) files and packs them to binary, which exactly halves them in size. Hexadecimal files should be an even number of bytes long and only contain (0-9,a-f) ascii characters. There are a few allowed  exceptions: upper case A-F are accepted but when converted back, they will always end up in lower case. Spaces and newlines just get deleted. This tolerant policy may result in some differences being reported between the original and the reconstructed files. Then it is best to replace the original file with its cleaned up, reconstructed version.

`hexify` (C executable) is invoked by `dcrpt` to unpack the binary files back to their original hexadecimal form. In other words, it carries out an inverse operation to `hexcheck` above.

`base64` (linux utility), invoked by `ncrpt -b`, recognises base64 files, resulting in 25% size reduction in their case (before final general compression). Base64 files should not contain any non base64 characters, such as newlines, otherwise this strict test will reject them. This utility is also deployed in inverse mode by `dcrpt`.

`lzma` or `zstd` (linux utilities) are general compression methods used here for the final compression, as long as it will result in some size reduction. This is not necessarily the case for small and/or binary files. Any  incomressible files are detected and encrypted as they are, even if their extension name is not on the list. However, if it is on the list, the test  compression is avoided.

`symcrypt` (C executable) applies fast symmetric XOR encryption (or decryption). It XORs together two files of any kind but they must have the same length. The ordering of the two input files does not even matter.

`keygen file > key` writes to stdout random binary data of the same length as the given file. It is called by `ncrpt`.

`hexgen size`  writes to stdout `size` bytes of random hexadecimal data. It is only useful for generating test data.

`b64gen size` writes to stdout `size` bytes of random base64 data. It is only useful for generating test data.

## Testing

`crptest indir`

Tests `ncrpt` and `dcrpt`. It first encrypts and then decrypts
all the files in the given input directory and compares the results against the original files. Finally, it cleans up all the created directories.

The reported compression/decompression rates and sizes should exactly match.

The reconstructed files should be reported as being identical to the originals.
Some character differences may arise for hexadecimal files because `hexcheck` converts both a-f and A-F to 10-15 and also it cleans up spurious spaces and newlines, instead of just rejecting files. API keys should be separated into their own  unique files. If the spaces/newlines turn out to be an unintended corruption, then the original file ought to be replaced by the cleaned up (reconstructed) version (see FAQ.md).

`expimptest indir`

Much like the above test but tests the export-import scripts `expcrypt` and `impcrypt` instead.

An automated github action compiles the C programs and runs both `crptest`  and `expimptest` over the `testing` directory included in the repository.
It tests all the main types of files: hexadecimal, base64, plain text and binary. It also tests reursive descent into a subdirectory. The 'test' badge at the top of this document lights up green
when all the tests were passed. Note that only the summary output `test.log` is saved in the repository, not the encrypted, decrypted or key directories.

### Exercise

Suppose you maintain some git repository, say `mygitrepo`. Go one level up:  `cd ..`, and run:  
`ncrpt -r mygitrepo mygitkeys gencrypted`  
Then, after some new trivial push from your repository, go back and run:  
`ncrpt -r -u -c mygitrepo mygitkeys gencrypted`  
This will update only the file(s) that you changed. What may come as a surprise is also the number of files added/changed by git in `.git`.

Note that TokenCrypt does not leave any such large hidden footprints on your filesystem.
